# Usage

## Configuring your project

Due to the way variables in Sass work you need to overwrite any variable you want change by including it **before** including Backbreeze. It is recommended that you create a main sass file and include all other files in it. In that file include a `_vars.scss` file that holds your custom variables (this can be any variables not only Backbreeze customizations).

```scss
// main.scss

// Include a file with your custom variables to ovewrite Backbreeze defaults
@include 'vars';

// All other includes
@include 'node_modules/destyle.css';
@include 'my-include';
@include 'my-other-include';

// Include Backbreeze last
// The path might vary depending on your setup
@include 'node_modules/backbreeze/src/';
```

Inside your variables file it is recommended that you always customize the following general variables to personalize your project:

```scss
$bb-bps: (/* ... */);
$bb-spacing: (/* ... */);
$bb-colors: (/* ... */);

$bb-font-size-values: (/* ... */);
$bb-line-height-values: (/* ... */);
```

## Reset stylesheet

It is recommended to use a reset style sheet of some kind, that can be [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) oder (shameless plug ahead) [destyle.css](https://nicolas-cusan.github.io/destyle.css/) which is well suited to style everything with classes as it removes all browser default styles, this way classes are only _additive_ and do not have to be used to remove styles

## The class names

Backbreeze uses some conventions about the class names it generates. In general class names try to be short but not to clever to make guessing a class name easy. If there is a conflict with two names the more (likely) frequently used one will have a shorter name.

Pattern:

```
.[-][<PREFIX>-]<PROPERTY NAME>-<VALUE>[:<PSEUDO>][@<BREAKPOINT>]
```

Pattern break down:

- `[-]` Classes with negative values start with a `-` (dash).
- `[<PREFIX>-]` Prefix or namespace to distinguish Backbreeze classes from others, set via `$bb-prefix`. By default there is no prefix set.
- `<PROPERTY NAME>` Name of the property the class is setting. If it is a frequent property the name will likely be short e.g. a single letter, if it is a more infrequent property the name will likely be longer.
- `<VALUE>` Property value set via the key in the values variable for this utility.
- `[:<PSEUDO>]` Activation of the property on this pseudo selector e.g. `:hover`, `:focus`.
- `[@<BREAKPOINT>]` Breakpoint on which to apply this class e.g. `@sm`: from `sm` screens upwards

Example (without prefix)

```html
<div class="p-20 p-40@sm -mb-30">
  <h2 class="fs-20 lh-1.2">
    <a class="c-primary:hover@md" href="#">
      John Smith
    </a>
  </h2>
</div>
```

## Negative values

Negative values are generated automatically for CSS properties to whom it is useful by default. These properties are defined in the internal variable `$bb-negative-properties`. So adding a positive value will also generate a negative counterpart:

```scss
$bb-top-values: (
  '10': 10px,
);
```

Will yield

```css
.top-10 {
  top: 10px;
}

.-top-10 {
  top: -10px;
}
```

Negative values / classes can also be created by prefixing value keys in property-driven variables with a dash (`-`). This pattern does not make the value automatically negative you have to take of that yourself. This feature is useful for use with more complicated values like transforms.

```scss
$bb-transform-values: (
  '-50\\%': translate(-50%, -50%),
);
```

Will yield

```css
.-tf-50\% {
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

## Customizing

## Using Backbreeze variables in your code

As everything is just Sass you can use all variables via the regular sass mechanisms:

```scss
// Using some color in a module
.my-module {
  color: map-get($bb-color, 'primary');
}
```

You can also use your own variables to define Backbreeze values:

```scss
$primary: #4a90e2;

// Use color in Backbreeze classes
$bb-color: (
  'primary': $primary,
);

// Use color in a module
.my-module {
  color: $primary;
}
```

### Using default values

Some

- customization
- reposnsive
- multi class utility classes
- Abstract vs. concrete (use values like 'large': 40px, vs. '20': 20px,)
