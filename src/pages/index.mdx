    title="Home"
    subline="Backbreeze is a utility class library written in Sass. It provides classes that help you create custom designs fast."
  >
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);

## Features

- Written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), configuration in Sass
- Project specific configuration instead of lots of defaults, designed to build project specific style systems
- Can be dropped in to existing Sass projects
- Responsive and mobile first
- Short class names derived from the CSS property they apply to make _guessing_ class names easy

## Why Sass?

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is an industry standard that is widely used. In contrast to combining different PostCSS plugins it has a full language spec that makes it easier to port code between projects and has a superior authoring experience. Still PostCSS is great to process the generated CSS and its used is definitely encouraged when using [Backbreeze in production](/using-in-production).

## Inspired by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Backbreeze is inspired by the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework. It aims to be an alternative that you can drop into existing projects that use Sass.

## Who is this library for?

- Developers that enjoy working with utility classes and appreciate the approach.
- Developers that like to work with Sass.
