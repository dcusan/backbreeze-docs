# Installation

## Using Backbreeze in your Sass project.

There are multiple ways to use Sass, this guide assumes that you have a running Sass setup. All Testing for this library is done using [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass).

## Installation via NPM

Backbreeze is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```bash
$ npm install backbreeze
```

Alternatively you can clone the git repository. And copy the files to some location in your project. This approach is not recommended as you will not have automatic updates and bug fixes.

```bash
# Clone from GitHub
$ git clone https://github.com/nicolas-cusan/backbreeze.git

# Go into directory
$ cd backbreeze

# Remove the git folder
$ rm -rf .git
```

## Including in your project

Backbreeze provides two Sass partials: `_config.scss` and `_utilities.scss`. Due to the way default variables work in Sass you need to overwrite any Backbreeze variables **before** including the Backbreeze `_config.scss` file. It is recommended to include the `_utilities.scss` partial last to enable overwriting of module styles.

```scss
// main.scss

// Project variables that to ovewrite Backbreeze default variables
@include 'vars';

// Bachbreeze `_config.scss` (file path might vary depending on your setup)
@include 'node_modules/backbreeze/src/config';

// All other project includes
@include 'node_modules/destyle.css';
@include 'my-include';
@include 'my-other-include';
// ....

// Backbreeze `_utilities.scss` last to overwrite any other styles (file path might vary depending on your setup)
@include 'node_modules/backbreeze/src/utilities';
```

## Usage via CDN

Usage via CDN is not recommended as Backbreeze does not provide a lot of default values. In addition as Backbreeze generates a lot of classes file size might be an issue. It is highly recommended to remove unused classes from your code base for production, you can learn more about it here.
